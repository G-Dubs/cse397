# George Wieland

**Background**:  
I'm a Computer Science student who will be graduating at the end of the semester. I hope to work in video game development someday.

**Home**:  
Sicklerville, New Jersey

**Interests**:  
I like board games and card games.

**Unique**:  
I like to write a book series, *The Adventures of Spy George*. It mashes up characters from different movies/books that I like, creating a giant world. My favorite part of the story is adding characters based on my friends.  This is a movie poster I made based on one of the books.

**Photo**: 
I also like to make Yu-Gi-Oh! cards. One of my creations is based on my friend Vlad's car. It would always break down, so I gave it the effect to cause you to lose the duel if you drew the card.

**Resume**:  
I have two versions of my resume:  
- [Cover Letter (Epic Games)](./Cover%20Letter%20(Epic%20Games).docx)  
- [Resume](./Resume.docx)  
- [Resume (2 Pages)](./Resume%20(2%20Pages).docx)  

A friend in my ward who was helping me look for internships wanted to show my resume with a second page listing specific programming skills I've learned. The only other change I made was following advice from the career center.
