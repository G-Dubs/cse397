# Resume Improvements
- Making the second page focus on projects I have worked on sounds like a good idea.
- Ranking my skills by level of proficiency also seems like it would be beneficial.
- Someone mentioned listing their Senior Project, which I forgot to do.

# Job Posting & Evaluation
- [Job 1](https://byui.joinhandshake.com/stu/jobs/9267570?utm_campaign=job_recommendation_digest&utm_source=job_recommendation_mailer&utm_medium=email): This job requires a Computer Science major, which matches my qualifications, but Cyber Security is not my strong suit, so I did not apply. Also, they want someone who already graduated.
- [Job 2](https://byui.joinhandshake.com/stu/jobs/9188443?utm_campaign=job_recommendation_digest&utm_source=job_recommendation_mailer&utm_medium=email): This application also specifies that they want someone who has graduated. It's interesting because this is a business designer job, a bit outside my wheelhouse, so I didn’t apply for this either.
- [Job 3](https://byui.joinhandshake.com/stu/jobs/9132318?utm_campaign=job_recommendation_digest&utm_source=job_recommendation_mailer&utm_medium=email): This job requires experience with something called Kubernetes, which I don’t know. It also requires Python experience, which I do know. If I learn the other skills, this could be a good match.

# Equivalent Job Skills
- Some required skills for these jobs include Python, Azure, Salt, a degree in Computer Science, and 2-4 years of work experience.

# Improvements
- I would like to know more about AI, such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or Claude.  Specifically, I'd like to learn how to use those tools to help me improve my workflow when working on projects.

# SMART Goals
- Learning various programming languages and familiarizing myself with different environments and IDEs seems to be a common thread in the job applications. Having these skills would help with future applications.
- I reviewed the resumes of classmates Brycen Williams, Jackson Westover, and Mike Menjivar-McGrath to identify improvements for my own resume.

**Goals:**
- Add my Senior Project to my resume, and rank the list of skills on the second page based on proficiency by the end of the week.
- Graduate by the end of the semester.  Doing this will allow me to qualify for any job applications which require someone who has graduated.  As I work on this Professional Project class (need to graduate) I will also gain some of the skills required in various job applications.
